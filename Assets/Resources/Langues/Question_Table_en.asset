    m_Localized: Researchers at the Technical University of Munich are using genetically
      modified pigs to model various human cancers. Due to their physiological similarities
      to humans, these pigs enable more relevant research. The use of "humanized"

    m_Localized: Dogs and cats with natural cancers greatly contribute to cancer
      research. Since their cancers are similar to those in humans, studying them
      allows scientists to develop new treatments and prevention methods. This approach,
      called "comparative oncology," accelerates drug development and improves treatment
      strategies.

    m_Localized: According to a study from Oxford, bats could hold vital clues to
      defeating cancer. Researchers examined how these animals are able to host and
      survive infections like Covid-19. By better understanding the immune mechanisms
      of bats, it may be possible to find a solution to prevent certain epidemics
      and treat some diseases in humans.

    m_Localized: Elephants are helping cancer research because they rarely develop
      cancer. Scientists have discovered that they possess many copies of a key cancer-fighting
      gene (TP53), which allows their cells to self-destruct when damaged, thus preventing
      tumor formation. This research is inspiring new methods for cancer prevention
      and treatment for humans.
