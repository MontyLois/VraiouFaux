    m_Localized: The healthy weight range, often described by BMI (Body Mass Index),
      is between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 65462874116
    m_Localized: Being underweight or overweight can be harmful to health; weight

    m_Localized: 'It is recommended not to exceed 5-6g of salt per day. This amount
      helps reduce the risk of stomach cancer and other diseases. Be careful: most
      dietary salt comes from processed foods (highly processed products).'

  - m_Id: 65462874122
    m_Localized: Even when it is cloudy or foggy, you can still get sunburned because
      up to 80% of UV radiation passes through clouds or mist. A beach umbrella blocks
      only 40-50% of UV rays.

    m_Localized: Mice are essential in cancer research due to their genetic similarity
      to humans. They help study tumor development, test treatments, and analyze
      environmental cancer risks. Genetically modified and immunocompromised mice
      provide insights into human cancer, making them crucial for advancing therapies.

  - m_Id: 65462874134
    m_Localized: Researchers at the Technical University of Munich are using genetically
      modified pigs to model various human cancers. Due to their physiological similarities
      to humans, these pigs enable more relevant research. The use of "humanized"
      pigs with transplanted human cancer tissues also shows great potential for
      better understanding and treating these diseases.

    m_Localized: Snake venom has led to the identification of an interaction between
      a receptor on the surface of blood platelets and a protein expressed on the
      surface of cancer cells, which aids in cancer spread.

  - m_Id: 65467068417
    m_Localized: Dogs and cats with natural cancers greatly contribute to cancer
      research. Since their cancers are similar to those in humans, studying them
      allows scientists to develop new treatments and prevention methods. This approach,
      called "comparative oncology," accelerates drug development and improves treatment
      strategies.

  - m_Id: 65467068418
    m_Localized: According to a study from Oxford, bats could hold vital clues to
      defeating cancer. Researchers examined how these animals are able to host and
      survive infections like Covid-19. By better understanding the immune mechanisms
      of bats, it may be possible to find a solution to prevent certain epidemics
      and treat some diseases in humans.

    m_Localized: A component found in bee venom could be used to create an innovative
      treatment for triple-negative or HER-2 breast cancers, suggests an Australian
      study. While the results are promising, further research is needed before any
      potential therapeutic outcomes.

    m_Localized: Elephants are helping cancer research because they rarely develop
      cancer. Scientists have discovered that they possess many copies of a key cancer-fighting
      gene (TP53), which allows their cells to self-destruct when damaged, thus preventing
      tumor formation. This research is inspiring new methods for cancer prevention
      and treatment for humans.
